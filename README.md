# Harvard University's CS50: Introduction to Computer Science

Problems and labs from the Harvard University CS50 course

## CS50 Library
The programs in this course make use of the [CS50 C Library](https://github.com/cs50/libcs50). For simplicity, the library is included in `lib/` and linked to each C program during compilation.

## Usage
1. Download or clone the repository and navigate to the root folder
2. Run `make` to compile all C programs
3. Run any of the programs in sub-folders to test their functionality
4. Run `make clean` (in root directory) to remove all compiled files
