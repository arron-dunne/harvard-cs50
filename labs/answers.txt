sort1 uses: Bubble

How do you know?: Is is the fastest to sort a sorted list. Bubble sort exits
after 1 loop if no elements were swapped.

sort2 uses: Merge

How do you know?: It is the fastest to sort a random list. Merge sort is
significantly faster than slecetion and merge for unsorted lists becuase it
uses a diver-and-conquer technique.

sort3 uses: Selection

How do you know?: It is slow for both random and unsorted lists. This is because
selection still goes through each loop and selects the smallest element, even
if it is already in the correct place.
